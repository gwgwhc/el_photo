A jekyll powered website for my personal photography, forked from @SamD97.

It is a basic two column layout with the main css for site structure contained in skeleton.css, a flexible template from http://getskeleton.com/ which was modified for this project.

Also included is [lightgallery.js](https://www.lightgalleryjs.com/) to display images in a fullscreen gallery. The related lightgallery.css file has been modified to make visual changes.

[Lozad](https://apoorv.pro/lozad.js/) is used for lazy image loading.
